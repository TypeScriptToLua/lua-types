     * A table used by require to control how to load modules.
     *
     * Each entry in this table is a searcher function. When looking for a module,
     * require calls each of these searchers in ascending order, with the module
     * name (the argument given to require) as its sole parameter. The function
     * can return another function (the module loader) plus an extra value that
     * will be passed to that loader, or a string explaining why it did not find
     * that module (or nil if it has nothing to say).
     *
     * Lua initializes this table with four searcher functions.
     *
     * The first searcher simply looks for a loader in the package.preload table.
     *
     * The second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library, using the path
     * stored at package.path. The search is done as described in function
     * package.searchpath.
     *
     * The third searcher looks for a loader as a C library, using the path given
     * by the variable package.cpath. Again, the search is done as described in
     * function package.searchpath. For instance, if the C path is the string
     *
     * `./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so`
     *
     * the searcher for module foo will try to open the files ./foo.so, ./foo.dll,
     * and /usr/local/foo/init.so, in that order. Once it finds a C library, this
     * searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the application with
     * the library. Then it tries to find a C function inside the library to be
     * used as the loader. The name of this C function is the string "luaopen_"
     * concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot is replaced by
     * an underscore. Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen, its suffix after
     * (and including) the first hyphen is removed. For instance, if the module
     * name is a.b.c-v2.1, the function name will be luaopen_a_b_c.
     *
     * The fourth searcher tries an all-in-one loader. It searches the C path for
     * a library for the root name of the given module. For instance, when
     * requiring a.b.c, it will search for a C library for a. If found, it looks
     * into it for an open function for the submodule; in our example, that would
     * be luaopen_a_b_c. With this facility, a package can pack several C
     * submodules into one single library, with each submodule keeping its
     * original open function.
     *
     * All searchers except the first one (preload) return as the extra value the
     * file name where the module was found, as returned by package.searchpath.
     * The first searcher returns no extra value.
