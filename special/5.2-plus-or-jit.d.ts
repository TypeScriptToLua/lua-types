/**
 * Loads a chunk.
 *
 * If chunk is a string, the chunk is this string. If chunk is a function, load
 * calls it repeatedly to get the chunk pieces. Each call to chunk must return a
 * string that concatenates with previous results. A return of an empty string,
 * nil, or no value signals the end of the chunk.
 *
 * If there are no syntactic errors, returns the compiled chunk as a function;
 * otherwise, returns nil plus the error message.
 *
 * If the resulting function has upvalues, the first upvalue is set to the value
 * of env, if that parameter is given, or to the value of the global
 * environment. Other upvalues are initialized with nil. (When you load a main
 * chunk, the resulting function will always have exactly one upvalue, the _ENV
 * variable (see ยง2.2). However, when you load a binary chunk created from a
 * function (see string.dump), the resulting function can have an arbitrary
 * number of upvalues.) All upvalues are fresh, that is, they are not shared
 * with any other function.
 *
 * chunkname is used as the name of the chunk for error messages and debug
 * information (see ยง4.9). When absent, it defaults to chunk, if chunk is a
 * string, or to "=(load)" otherwise.
 *
 * The string mode controls whether the chunk can be text or binary (that is, a
 * precompiled chunk). It may be the string "b" (only binary chunks), "t" (only
 * text chunks), or "bt" (both binary and text). The default is "bt".
 *
 * Lua does not check the consistency of binary chunks. Maliciously crafted
 * binary chunks can crash the interpreter.
