/**
 * This library provides generic functions for string manipulation, such as
 * finding and extracting substrings, and pattern matching. When indexing a
 * string in Lua, the first character is at position 1 (not at 0, as in C).
 * Indices are allowed to be negative and are interpreted as indexing backwards,
 * from the end of the string. Thus, the last character is at position -1, and
 * so on.
 *
 * The string library provides all its functions inside the table string. It
 * also sets a metatable for strings where the __index field points to the
 * string table. Therefore, you can use the string functions in object-oriented
 * style. For instance, string.byte(s,i) can be written as s:byte(i).
 *
 * The string library assumes one-byte character encodings.

     * not supported and that there is an extra option, q.

     * support any modifier (flags, width, length).

     * to one following the same rules of tostring. If the option has any modifier
     * (flags, width, length), the string argument should not contain embedded
     * zeros.
