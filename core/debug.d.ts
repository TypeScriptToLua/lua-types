/**
 * This library provides the functionality of the debug interface (ยง4.9) to Lua
 * programs. You should exert care when using this library. Several of its
 * functions violate basic assumptions about Lua code (e.g., that variables
 * local to a function cannot be accessed from outside; that userdata metatables
 * cannot be changed by Lua code; that Lua programs do not crash) and therefore
 * can compromise otherwise secure code. Moreover, some functions in this
 * library may be slow.
 *
 * All functions in this library are provided inside the debug table. All
 * functions that operate over a thread have an optional first argument which is
 * the thread to operate over. The default is always the current thread.
