/**
 * The I/O library provides two different styles for file manipulation. The
 * first one uses implicit file handles; that is, there are operations to set a
 * default input file and a default output file, and all input/output operations
 * are over these default files. The second style uses explicit file handles.
 *
 * When using implicit file handles, all operations are supplied by table io.
 * When using explicit file handles, the operation io.open returns a file handle
 * and then all operations are supplied as methods of the file handle.
 *
 * The table io also provides three predefined file handles with their usual
 * meanings from C: io.stdin, io.stdout, and io.stderr. The I/O library never
 * closes these files.
 *
 * Unless otherwise stated, all I/O functions return nil on failure (plus an
 * error message as a second result and a system-dependent error code as a third
 * result) and some value different from nil on success. On non-POSIX systems,
 * the computation of the error message and error code in case of errors may be
 * not thread safe, because they rely on the global C variable errno.
